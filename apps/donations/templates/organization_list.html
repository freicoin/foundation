<h3>List of non-profit organizations:</h3>

<p>
  The non-profit organizations in the following list can receive
  Freicoins from the foundation depending on how much receive on
  donations. The foundation will match donations so that the more
  Freicoins and/or Bitcoins you donate to them, the more they will
  receive from the foundation.
